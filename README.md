# Inverse Time Limit Theory (ITLT)

### Defining the Temporal Inversion Constant ($k_{inv}$) at the Planck Scale

**Author:** Independent Researcher (Abhay)

## 🌌 Abstract
The **Inverse Time Limit Theory (ITLT)** proposes a solution to the singularity problem in quantum mechanics. It posits that the Planck Length ($l_p$) is not merely a spatial limit, but a **Static Boundary** where Time Dilation reaches an infinite asymptote.

By introducing the **Temporal Inversion Constant ($k_{inv}$)**, which is equivalent to the Planck Time ($t_p$), this model maps the topology of time resistance at the quantum scale.

## 📐 The Master Equation
The behavior of time ($T$) at a distance ($x$) from the center is given by:

$$T(x) = \frac{k_{inv}}{\sqrt{1 - (l_p/x)^2}}$$

Where:
- **$x$**: Distance from the center.
- **$l_p$**: Planck Length (The Static Boundary).
- **$k_{inv}$**: Temporal Inversion Constant ($5.39 \times 10^{-44} s$).

## 📊 Key Findings
1. **The Static Boundary ($x = l_p$):** Time dilation becomes infinite, creating a natural shield against infinite energy density (Singularity).
2. **Phase Transition ($x = 2l_p$):** The simulation identifies $2l_p$ as the threshold where quantum probabilities stabilize into computable classical physics.
3. **Uncertainty Correction:** The model suggests that Heisenberg's uncertainty is a derivative of extreme time dilation at this scale.

## 🚀 How to Run the Simulation
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the script: `python itlt_simulation.py`
3. Check the generated `itlt_graph.png` and `itlt_data_export.csv`.
